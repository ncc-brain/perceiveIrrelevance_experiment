    "# Perceived irrelevance\n",

    "Understanding how specific features of consciously experienced stimuli are represented in the brain is fundamental to consciousness research. Previous studies have investigated which attributes of consciously perceived stimuli—such as category, orientation, and duration—are encoded in different brain regions. One significant finding from these studies was that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents only category-specific information (e.g., distinguishing between different types of objects), while failing to represent other features like orientation and duration of visual stimuli. This result poses a challenge to certain theories of consciousness, such as the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), which posits that the PFC plays a critical role in conscious experience by integrating all consciously perceived features.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the PFC truly underpins conscious experience, it would be expected to encode not just categorical information but also other consciously experienced features, like orientation and duration. Therefore, the lack of such representation in the PFC brings up two key possibilities:\n",
    "1. Only categorical features are consciously experienced, meaning participants may be unaware of orientation and duration details.\n",
    "2. If participants are, in fact, consciously aware of orientation and duration, the PFC’s lack of representation of these features questions theories (e.g., GNWT) that assign this region a primary role in supporting conscious experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we aimed to explore these possibilities further by investigating whether participants consciously experience features that were previously undetectable in the PFC. We designed a surprise memory paradigm to test participants' awareness of orientation and duration of visual stimuli. In this experiment, participants performed a target detection task across a series of 43 trials, where they viewed visual stimuli presented with varying orientations and durations. This task setup matched that of prior studies in which the PFC failed to represent these non-categorical features. However, after the initial task trials, participants were unexpectedly presented with memory probes asking them to recall the orientation and duration of the stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing this design, we ensured that participants’ attention to orientation and duration was comparable to that in previous studies. The surprise memory probe allowed us to assess whether, despite the lack of decodable representation in the PFC, participants consciously experienced these features. This study thus provides a critical test of the GNWT and similar theories, helping clarify the role of the PFC in conscious perception."
